This coursework involved cleaning and traning a dataset of real vs fake social media posts of events happenning in the world.

The cleanup on the database consisted of removing duplicates and unecessary characters from tweets, and stripping posts until just the necessary information was left to use.

After that, many different types of regression and best-fit lines were tested on the stripped data, and training/test data splits were conducted to measure the accuracy of these prediction algorithms.
